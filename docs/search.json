    "text": "I am a Chicago-based urban planner with an interest in the role of public space and play in climate change adaptation. I believe our cities and towns can not only be more inclusive, accessible, and climate-resilient, but also more fun for everyone.\nI will graduate from the University of Illinois Chicago’s Master of Urban Planning and Policy program in May 2024, and I am seeking professional opportunities relating to civic technology, GIS, and data visualization.\nI built this website using R, and you can view the repository on GitHub here."

The animation makes the injuries of urban renewal apparent. Vacant lots, surface parking, and institutional uses with large setbacks replaced an entire neighborhood in the southern portion of the district from the 1970s through the 2000s.\n\nThis GIF was produced in Photoshop using a combination of historic aerial imagery from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and images from Google Earth."

    "text": "New Nicollet Redevelopment\nAs part of the American Planning Association 2024 Student Planning and Design Competition, I developed a GIF of aerial imagery over time of the project site: a former Kmart in Minneapolis, Minnesota along Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue. The construction of this KMart required the closure of Nicollet Avenue at Lake Street to accommodate the building and its parking lot, cutting off the area south of Lake Street from an important corridor.\nThe City of Minneapolis approved the termination of the Kmart lease in 2020 with the goal of reconnecting Nicollet. This GIF illustrates how disruptive both the construction of Interstate 35W and the development of the Kmart was to the urban tissue of the neighborhood.\nView more of my work on this project here.\n\nThis GIF was produced in Photoshop using a combination of historic aerial imagery from the Metropolitan Council and images from Google Earth."
