I believe our cities and towns can not only be more inclusive, accessible, and climate-resilient, but also more fun for everyone, and I am passionate about the potential of zoning and land use reform to achieve these outcomes.\nI will graduate from the University of Illinois Chicago’s Master of Urban Planning and Policy program in May 2024, and I have experience with data analysis, grant-making, grant administration, arts and cultural programming, and community engagement. I am seeking professional opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful, creative projects; leverage my skills with GIS, R, writing, and graphic design; and build new proficiencies.\nI built this website using R, and you can view the repository on GitHub here."

The construction of this KMart required the closure of Nicollet Avenue at Lake Street to accommodate the building and its parking lot, cutting off the area south of Lake Street from an important corridor.\nThe City of Minneapolis approved the termination of the Kmart lease in 2020 with the goal of reconnecting Nicollet. This GIF illustrates how disruptive both the construction of Interstate 35W and the development of the Kmart was to the urban tissue of the neighborhood.\nView more of my work on this project here.\n\nThis GIF was produced in Photoshop using a combination of historic aerial imagery from the University of Minnesota and images from Google Earth."

    "text": "Introduction\nLike most resources and assets in Chicago, there are spatial patterns underlying the distribution of naturally occurring affordable housing and stock intentionally created to be “affordable” in the city. As the demand for affordable housing continues to outweigh Chicago’s supply, we are interested in analyzing the various factors that could help highlight areas prime for new developments.\nOur research and analysis focus on the development of a tool that allows for a more comprehensive view of suitable sites for the development of affordable housing across Chicago. We recognize that in addition to other similar assets across the city often associated with certain socioeconomic factors, there are often underlying spatial patterns that guide where and why affordable housing developments are physically manifested.\nWe are not so much interested in the natural distribution of affordable housing across Chicago as we are in creating a set of standards that outline where such developments could appropriately be built in the future. Since we know that the demand for affordable housing in Chicago is ever-growing, we recognize the need for a more detailed view of suitable sites, even those that may have been previously ignored. Using several tools and methods in GIS, we have created an interactive tool that allows one to view the appropriate sites across the city and the various factors that make them such according to our metrics."

We do not want to include projections in our analysis unless absolutely necessary, so we will filter out years greater than 2020.\nDocumentation from CMAP indicates that the towns of Inverness, South Barrington, Barrington Hills, Orland Hills, and Deer Park were omitted from the dataset because they either did not have a municipal-scale community water supply system or had other complications with the service area that required exclusion from the data. Justice and Willow Springs were combined in the CMAP dataset.\nWe too will exclude Inverness, South Barrington, Barrington Hills, Orland Hills, and Deer Park from our analysis as well because their water supply system differs so significantly from the rest of the dataset. Before joining the CMAP dataset to the list of municipalities in Cook County, we will change the name of “Justice” to match the “Justice-Willow Springs” entry in the CMAP dataset.

Now, we will look at duplicates to assess how to deal with them.\n\nfsi_score %&gt;%\n  group_by(Municipality) %&gt;%\n  filter(n() &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nThe aggregated FSI is identical among any duplicate instances, so at this point, we can remove duplicates.\n\nfsi_score &lt;- fsi_score %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\nNow, we can check for missing values in the data.\n\nfsi_score %&gt;%\n  filter(if_any(everything(), ~is.na(.))) # there are 0\n\nAll datasets seem tidy at this point, because each variable has its own column, each row is an observation, and each value has its own cell.\nThe unit of observation for cook_water and cook_housing is municipality in Cook County by year. Each observation now has its own row. The unit of observation for the flood susceptibility index is municipality in Cook County. The FSI was devised in 2018 but is meant to be a long-term guide for flood mitigation efforts that indicates long ranging trends in the area, not a point-in-time dataset.\nAt this point, we can join the data that have matching units of observation. We will also ensure that the “year” column is being treated as a number.\n\ncook_water_housingdensity &lt;- full_join(cook_housing, cook_water,\n                                       join_by(year == year,\n                                               Municipality == Municipality))\n\ncook_water_housingdensity &lt;-\n  cook_water_housingdensity %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))\n\nWe will also join housing density in the county for 2020 to the flood susceptibility index to investigate current conditions regarding flood risk and housing density.\n\nhousing_FSI_2020 &lt;- \n  housingdensity_2020 %&gt;%\n  select(c(NAME, housing_density)) %&gt;%\n  rename(Municipality = NAME,\n         units_per_sqmile = housing_density) %&gt;%\n  inner_join(fsi_score,\n             join_by(Municipality == Municipality)) %&gt;%\n  select(-c(agency_des)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(FSI = round(FSI, 2)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = 2020)\n\nWe have also checked for missing values and determined how to address them.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I wrote this blog post during my time in Hyde County, North Carolina as a Lead For North Carolina Americorps member to reflect on my experiences working in housing and grant administration in a rural, coastal county.\nOver the past few months, I have been administering a grant for urgent housing repairs to low-income households in Hyde County. I took over the project in late August from the previous grant administrator, who left the county before I began my fellowship. When she left, virtually all internal institutional knowledge of the grant vanished. The county had never received this grant before, so any chance of the county receiving this much-needed support again hinged on my successful completion of the project. With three months left in the project, I was tasked with overseeing 10 construction projects from bidding to completion while also bringing the project into compliance with the grant guidelines. I had never managed any construction projects before and had never administered a grant. The list of challenges that ensued is too lengthy to enumerate here, but the project followed Murphy’s Law: anything that could have gone wrong went wrong. The grant is in the monitoring stage now, so time will tell if my efforts were sufficient. At the end of the day, there are homeowners in the county who are able to sleep a little more soundly because of these home improvements.\nNot only did this project provide me with one of the most arduous, stressful, and rewarding learning experiences of my life, but it also demonstrated to me the interlocking nature of Hyde County’s struggles. This blog post serves as a wide-ranging, at times rambling, reflection on this process and its implications.\nThe purpose of the grant I administered is to address urgent needs – deteriorated parts of the house that could make the house uninhabitable, causing someone to relocate or, in a worst-case scenario, be injured or killed. Such repairs can allow someone to remain in their home when they would have otherwise had to leave the county to live with family or an assisted living facility. In a jurisdiction like Hyde, which is facing the dual specters of population loss and climate change, every household that stays in the county matters. Not only do the residents remain connected to the communities and land that raised them, but the county also maintains a tax base and a raison d’être.\nAll the recipients of these urgent repairs are elderly, single women who live alone or who serve as the primary caretaker of others in their household. When asked about their experience living in Hyde County, almost every woman told me, “There’s no place like home.” Some had lived in the county all their lives; some had returned after years of living elsewhere. Almost all were born there, and many within a 10-mile radius of their current home. Every homeowner had a unique knowledge of the land and history. Each could tell me exactly where water drained from their yard (one colleague told me of an interesting housing/drainage dynamic I had never considered: low-income residents who live near large farms often have better drainage than those who do not because farmers must invest in more sophisticated drainage measures to prevent crop loss and secure profits).\nMany of the repairs pertained to water or flood damage of some kind – a leaking roof, floors from rotting flooding damage, etc. – which comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the geography or socio-environmental history of Hyde County. Water is everywhere, pervades all discussions. Perhaps the county’s biggest claim to water fame was the draining of Lake Mattamuskeet – the state’s largest natural lake – to farm in the nutrient-rich lakebed in the 1800s. The lake has since filled back in with water after pumping ended in the 1930s. The pumping station remains an attraction, and the lake is now a destination for wildlife, birders, and hunters. Canals and dikes are the county’s legacy. One homeowner I spoke with discussed how the drainage ditch near her house used to be cleared regularly, but now, she has noticed that many of the ditches throughout the county do not receive the necessary maintenance.\n“Sustainable construction” often conjures images of sleek skyscrapers, new builds with LEED certification, and plant walls. While these are all well and good, upfitting the buildings we already have is frequently the more sustainable option. To frame my work on housing repairs, I return to this article in Places Journal by Sharon Mattern on maintenance and care. This project was often discouraging. The list of homeowners who needed support was lengthy, and even the homeowners who received repairs had additional housing needs not met by the grant. Moreover, renters did not even qualify for the grant. Once, I was meeting with my county manager to discuss a particularly difficult challenge and my nose started bleeding (she claims from stress) in her office. Viewing these repairs through an ethic of maintenance and care, however, helped me gain an appreciation for the outcomes of the project, even if they seem like small potatoes. We know that systems tend toward chaos, erosion, decay, and breakdown, and we are tasked with, as Mattern says, studying “how the world gets put back together.” The repair of some leaky roofs, front steps, floors, and windows in rural North Carolina is helping to put a tiny bit of the world back together.\nOf course, when it rains, it pours, and as this project drew to a close, we learned that the regional housing authority was closing an affordable housing development in the county, displacing several families and long-term residents. Such a population loss is significant in a county with fewer than 5,000 residents. Building new housing on the mainland is difficult because so much of the land in the county is either farmland or protected lands. Housing on Ocracoke presents its own challenges associated with climate change, housing seasonal workers, and vacation rentals.\nSome people like to joke that the county is 10 years behind the rest of the state. I think, for better or for worse, the county is 10 years ahead of many places in its resilience to climate change. County residents across the political spectrum are acutely aware of the threat of climate change because they are already living it – saltwater intrusion into farmland, flooding, hurricanes. As we near hurricane season, my coworkers are bracing for another big storm. September will mark the third year since Hurricane Dorian, and my colleagues have emphasized that we are overdue for another one. This underlines the pervasive housing struggle – what of the existing housing stock is equipped to withstand another storm? How many residents would have to relocate to another jurisdiction if their home is destroyed in a hurricane?\nMuch attention has been paid to housing crises in urban cores, and rightfully so, but concern is owed to rural residents as well. I find it difficult to articulate a response or solution that does not require a massive restructuring of society. Burnt-out county employees can only achieve so much. I find solace, however, in this quote from author Ursula K. Le Guin: “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.”"

As the demand for affordable housing continues to outweigh Chicago’s supply, we are interested in analyzing the various factors that could help highlight areas prime for new developments.\nOur research and analysis focus on the development of a tool that allows for a more comprehensive view of suitable sites for the development of affordable housing across Chicago. We recognize that in addition to other similar assets across the city often associated with certain socioeconomic factors, there are often underlying spatial patterns that guide where and why affordable housing developments are physically manifested.\nWe are not so much interested in the natural distribution of affordable housing across Chicago as we are in creating a set of standards that outline where such developments could appropriately be built in the future. Since we know that the demand for affordable housing in Chicago is ever-growing, we recognize the need for a more detailed view of suitable sites, even those that may have been previously ignored. Using several tools and methods in GIS, we have created an interactive tool that allows one to view the appropriate sites across the city and the various factors that make them such according to our metrics."

The centerline shapefile already contained a field describing the class of each road – alley, arterial, collector, expressway, local road, local slow, and ramp – so speed limits were determined based on this classification. Alleys were removed from the shapefile to facilitate faster processing speeds and because their low desirability for fast travel means that they would likely not impact the network analysis significantly.\nThe statewide speed limit for interstates near or around major cities in Illinois is 55 miles per hour, so this was the expressway speed limit for the first speed limit variable (SL1). In the City of Chicago (which takes up a significant area of Cook County), the speed limit is 30 miles per hour unless otherwise marked, so this was the speed limit for “local roads” in SL1 (“Automated Speed Enforcement Frequently Asked Questions” n.d.). “Local slow” features were treated as school zones and assigned a speed limit of 20 MPH in SL1 (“Automated Speed Enforcement Frequently Asked Questions” n.d.). Based on the speed limits of known roads each class and on the USDOT’s Federal Highway Administration’s classification system, “collector” and “arterial” roads were assigned 35 and 45 MPH speed limits respectively (“Road Function Classifications” 2000). Ramps were given a speed limit of 25 MPH based on Delamater’s classification system. \nThe second speed limit variable (SL2) was calculated by adding 10 to SL1. This is based both on anecdotal experience of high traffic speeds in the Chicagoland area and on guidelines for emergency vehicle drivers (Kupas 2017). Two different drive time estimates were calculated based on each speed limit variable."

The P9 data table on race and ethnicity at the block level was acquired for Cook County and joined to a shapefile of the blocks in Cook County, also sourced from the US Census Bureau (“P9, Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino By Race” 2020; “TIGER/Line 2020 Block Shapefile” 2020). A hospital shapefile for the county was acquired from the City of Chicago’s Open Data Portal (“Cook County - Hospitals,” n.d.). Hospitals that had closed were removed from the dataset, including Michael Reese Hospital, Neurologic and Orthopedic Institute of Chicago, Sacred Heart Hospital, MetroSouth, and Oak Forest (Ecker 2022; Grossman 2021; Swanson 2009; Wang and Schorsch 2013; “Oak Forest Demolition” n.d.)."

Three different turn delay settings were tested for each speed limit classification. One of the turn delay settings retained the default settings, one replicated Delamater’s most accurate network dataset (N5), and one involved no turn delays. The unique combinations of these settings resulted in the six network datasets that were considered for use in creating service area polygons for the hospitals. \nSince the shapefile of hospitals already contained addresses that could be easily verified and used in navigation software, 10 different hospital points were selected to serve as test points to compare the drive time estimates of each network dataset to drive time estimates of Google Maps and Waze. 5 test pairs were developed from these 10 points. Pairs were organized so the points were far from each other and in different areas of the county. A “route” analysis was run for each pair and compared to four different drive time scenarios from Google Maps and Waze. Waze was included to diversify the estimates used, and because the crowd-sourcing nature of the platform may increase accuracy of travel times. Two drive time scenarios involved arriving at 1 AM on a weeknight to remove traffic slowdowns characteristic of the area. See Appendix B for maps of each route, the resulting drive times, and the Google Maps and Waze estimates. \nThe network dataset using SL1 and default turn delay settings had the lowest average difference from the Google Maps and Waze drive time estimates, so this was determined to be the best network dataset for creating service polygons."
