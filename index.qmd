I am a Chicago-based urban planner with an interest in the role of public space and play in climate change adaptation. I believe our cities and towns can not only be more inclusive, accessible, and climate-resilient, but also more fun for everyone, and I am passionate about the potential of zoning and land use reform to achieve these outcomes.

I will graduate from the University of Illinois Chicago's Master of Urban Planning and Policy program in May 2024, and I have experience with data analysis, grant-making, grant administration, arts and cultural programming, and community engagement. I am seeking professional opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful, creative projects; leverage my skills with GIS, R, writing, and graphic design; and build new proficiencies.

I built this website using R, and you can [view the repository on GitHub here](https://github.com/emiller1031/portfolio).
