title: "Illinois Medical District"

*I produced these collages in Photoshop for a spring 2023 studio course aimed at creating a plan for the Illinois Medical District (IMD). My group's proposal involved recommendations for three critical zones in the district.*

# Campbell Square

One zone was envisioned as a vibrant meeting and living space that transitions between the historical Chicago neighbor- hoods to the modern retail stores and institutions of the IMD. This area, called "Campbell Park," would act as a bridge between residential Tri-Taylor, the institutional uses of the Tech Park, and the contemporary high-rises closer to the hospitals. The site design of Campbell Park includes an open plaza with new small-scale commercial opportunities, a walking path, and housing.

# Pedestrianized Intersection

Part of our proposal involved enhancing the pedestrian experience throughout the IMD through upgrading existing infrastructure, developing new walking and biking paths, and ensuring the connectivity of facilities. This collage features a scrambled crosswalk to ensure people walking and rolling can navigate the heavily trafficked intersection safely.
