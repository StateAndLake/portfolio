title: "GIS Approach to Siting Affordable Housing Developments: A Suitability Index"
---

*This project was completed in Fall of 2023 for an intermediate GIS course. I undertook this project in a group, but I developed the project methods, produced the flowchart using Illustrator, and was responsible for 50% of the write-up, data analysis, and StoryMap. I used R and Python to join assessed land value to a shapefile of parcels in Cook County and clip it to the City of Chicago. I encourage you to view [the StoryMap can be viewed here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/932381da2b374fb4afcdc0be675b981d) to interact with the maps and learn more about the effort.*

## Introduction

Like most resources and assets in Chicago, there are spatial patterns underlying the distribution of naturally occurring affordable housing and stock intentionally created to be “affordable” in the city. As the demand for affordable housing continues to outweigh Chicago’s supply, we are interested in analyzing the various factors that could help highlight areas prime for new developments.

Our research and analysis focus on the development of a tool that allows for a more comprehensive view of suitable sites for the development of affordable housing across Chicago. We recognize that in addition to other similar assets across the city often associated with certain socioeconomic factors, there are often underlying spatial patterns that guide where and why affordable housing developments are physically manifested.

We are not so much interested in the natural distribution of affordable housing across Chicago as we are in creating a set of standards that outline where such developments could appropriately be built in the future. Since we know that the demand for affordable housing in Chicago is ever-growing, we recognize the need for a more detailed view of suitable sites, even those that may have been previously ignored. Using several tools and methods in GIS, we have created an interactive tool that allows one to view the appropriate sites across the city and the various factors that make them such according to our metrics.

## Methods

# Results

Our final index raster produced a map with a concentration of higher index values on the South and West sides of Chicago. However, due to our 90 feet by 90 feet raster cell size, the final result is at a such a granular scale—almost at parcel scale. This results in a valuable output as although we could have predicted what regions or even neighborhoods of the city are likely to be identified, this map can be used with much greater accuracy for site selection.

# Limitations

This project was only able to incorporate spatial data. As such, it could not reflect the other factors of producing affordable housing that are not spatially dependent, such as the remainder of the funding sources beyond TIF districts and Enterprise Zones. Therefore, this suitability index can only be used as a tool to identify the optimal locations for affordable housing in Chicago but not predict where they are likely to be developed.

Furthermore, several critical datasets rely on somewhat outdated information. Vacant land relies on the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning’s Land Use Inventory, which has yet to be updated past 2018. Assessed land values are derived from a dataset from 2019, though all Cook County properties have received a new assessment since then. The 2019 dataset was selected because of the ability to join the shapefile to the assessed values table.

Above all, areas with low scores on this index should not be excluded from affordable housing site selection processes; we advocate for the widespread development for housing that fits the needs of communities. This tool can merely suggests where the ideal locations for such development might be.

# Future Research

This suitability index is intended as the first step for affordable housing developers and city officials to prioritize where new developments should be built. This does not distinguish the various types of affordable housing that exist, such as supportive housing versus senior. It also does not specify the target demographics in terms of percent of Area Median Income (beyond the 60% threshold), which will affect the relative placement as well as the funding that can be obtained.

This map should be used in conjunction with a view of the existing affordable housing supply in Chicago to take current supply into account. We envision this tool being used as the first step in a broader analysis of the housing landscape of Chicago to determine where affordable housing should be placed.
