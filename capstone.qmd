*This is an excerpt from my undergraduate capstone at Davidson College on the distribution of greenways in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. I used ArcGIS to investigate the socioeconomic characteristics of block groups within a half-mile of a greenway entrance. I found that there is a statistically significant relationship between proximity to greenways and the change in median property values, racial demographics, and median income of block groups in the county. Block groups that are within a half-mile of a greenway entrance are more likely to be predominantly white and affluent. The full document includes introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion sections. This except is a portion from a section detailing the project's theoretical framework and historical context.*

## Greenways

Searns (1995) writes that greenways have been popular methods of urban greening since the 1970s, in part because of railbanking that preserved unused railways and converted them into greenways, federal funding for transportation such as trails, and shifting public perceptions that valued greenways as a priority (Crompton and Nicholls 2019). Searns (1995) also writes that three “generations” of greenways exist. The first iteration, dating from 1700 to 1960, includes axes, boulevards, and parkways. The popularity of trail-oriented recreational greenways from 1960 to 1985 constitute the second generation. The current generation is multi-objective; in addition to being desirable aesthetic and recreational amenities, modern greenways are more adaptive-oriented than prior models. Mitigating erosion, reducing flood damage, preserving ecosystems, and improving water quality now explicitly motivate the creation of many greenways, though greenways alone cannot achieve these goals (Searns 1995).

Recent literature verifies the continued popularity of greenways, as residents acknowledge the cultural, experiential, and ecological benefits of greenways, though it appears that racial groups may experience and value these benefits differently (Larson et al. 2016). Ralston (2016) argues that urban greenways can connect communities and render cities more resilient to climate change, providing the example of Oakland, California. Part of the ideological framework that he presents involves forming civic partnerships, incorporating community visions into plans, and providing access to greenways to all neighborhoods (Ralston 2016, 48–50). Yet in assessing the efficacy of the project, Ralston neglects to address how successful researchers were in ensuring the accessibility of greenways.

Methods such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can help visualize the ecological, geographical, and demographic qualities of areas for greenway planning. However, this research often omits the social dimension of greenway planning (Conine et al. 2004). Recent literature has called for social justice-oriented greenway research and cautions against scaling up using GIS (Crompton and Nicholls 2019). Other studies employ GIS technology to visualize how proximity to greenways interacts with race (Coutts and Miles 2011; Brown 2010). Lindsey, Maraj, and Kuan (2001) use proximity to greenways as a measure of access in GIS analysis of equity of access of greenway trails in Indianapolis, Indiana. They argue that greenways constitute an important realm of public space, drawing from Jane Jacobs’s theory that encounters in public spaces are essential to city-building (Jacobs 1992).

Studies of the BeltLine in Atlanta indicate that race and class can inform how people interact with greenways (Weber et al. 2017; Palardy, Boley, and Gaither 2018). More affluent areas are typically more likely to support greenway projects. Other studies have indicated using surveys and geospatial analysis that greenways can serve ethnically and racially diverse communities and even be a “green magnet” that leads to racial co-mingling (Keith et al. 2018; Coutts and Miles 2011). These discrepancies indicate the necessity of contextualized, place-based research into how specific greenways do or do not contribute to environmental racism.

The type of trail can also impact whether or not green gentrification occurs. Urban “mega-trails,” (e.g. the High Line in New York City, the 606 in Chicago, and the BeltLine in Atlanta) are more likely to impact property values than smaller projects (Crompton and Nicholls 2019). Crompton and Nicholls (2019) define mega-trails as having enduring visibility and mass appeal while impacting the image or branding of a community. Thus, future research must also focus on the type of trail when considering the potential for displacement.

Though previous literature on environmental justice and green gentrification focuses on distributional justice, Rigolon and Németh (2018) discuss procedural justice, or the impact of planning processes on project outcomes. They examine The 606, a trail that precipitated environmental gentrification in Chicago. They suggest that delegating planning to nonprofits can increase the likelihood that gentrification will occur. Thus, the authors advocate for municipal planning across sectors and building sustainable coalitions between housing and park nonprofits.

Literature on North Carolina’s greenways indicates the potential for replicating environmental racism through inequitable planning or through gentrification. Furuseth and Altman’s (1991) study of a greenway in Raleigh suggested that most greenway patrons were childless white women between the ages of 16 and 34. Typical users were well-educated, employed, and had above-average incomes. In Charlotte, one study indicated that properties within 1,000 feet of the Catawba Regional Trail would experience an increase in property values (Campbell and Munroe 2007). Campbell and Munroe state that it would take at least four years for the increase to be capitalized into the properties, necessitating updated research on change in property values and an assessment of whether the change has precipitated displacement.

Some literature suggests that greenway parks may even cause greater gentrification than other forms of green space because of their connectivity to urban downtowns and recreational areas (Florida 2019). This indicates the necessity of research into individual greenway systems, as the gentrifying potential of greenways is dependent on myriad factors.

## History of County's Development

Mecklenburg County exists on land that European settlers stole from indigenous Catawba, Sugaree, and Waxhaw nations. The first white settlers to the region arrived in 1753 (Hanchett 1998, 14).  Thus, racial and economic segregation evident in the 20th century and today are couched in the region’s (and nation’s) history of white supremacy. Moreover, neoliberal policy relies on the same extractive logic as land-grabbing settler colonialist practices (Anguelovski et al. 2018).

Before industrialization, Mecklenburg County consisted primarily of agricultural villages, with Charlotte serving as a trading village and the courthouse town for the county (Hanchett 1998, 14). The agricultural system relied on slave labor, as in 1850, about 44% of Charlotte’s population were enslaved people, and “many of the town’s leading merchants and professionals owned slaves…as both an investment and a symbol of status” (Greenwood 1994, 21). The post-Civil War wave of industrialization transformed the city into a hub for trade, railways, and the cotton and textile industry (Hanchett 1998, 11). Several more rural areas in the county, such as Cornelius, Huntersville, and Pineville, were also home to textile mills (Hanchett 1998, 93) The southern legacy of disenfranchisement for Black people sequestered governmental power into the hands of a few elite whites (Hanchett 1998, 12). As the population of the city increased in the early 1900s, mill towns and neighborhoods emerged to house workers (Hanchett 1998). “Residential intermingling” thus ended in the county, resulting in racially segregated neighborhoods in a “patchwork” pattern (Hanchett 1998). To the east of downtown, a Black business district developed, while the Biddleville area in the west of the city formed another Black “nucleus” (Hanchett 1998, 116). Wealthy whites resided primarily in the Dilworth and Myers Park areas in the south of the city, and working-class whites lived in mill towns and in North Charlotte (Hanchett 1998, 114). As the city and county became increasingly racially segregated, wealthy white residents moved to the suburbs, “a halo of new single-class, white-collar neighborhoods” surrounding Charlotte, despite affluent people previously residing alongside working-class residents (Hanchett 1998, 146).

Charlotte remained without an official city plan throughout the entire first half of the twentieth century (Hanchett 1998, 219). In 1917, one plan composed by John Nolen “sought to knit the city together” and proposed that “public outlay should provide parks in areas too poor to finance such amenities themselves. All parks should form a network of greenways that everyone could share. Likewise, the boulevards and belt road would give anybody easy access to any part of town” (Hanchett 1998, 219). The “commercial-civic elite” monopolized political power and did not adopt the plan, as there was “‘a hesitancy on the part of government officials to offer social services which would benefit the lower class’” (Kathryn and Harold Stone quoted in Hanchett 1998, 222).

From the 1930s to the 1970s, residential composition in Charlotte remained racially segregated but evolved into a crescent and wedge dynamic in which whiter, wealthier neighborhoods remained in a southeastern wedge sector extending into downtown, while working- and middle-class communities of color were relegated to a crescent sector (Hanchett 1998, 224; see Figure 1). Federal New Deal projects of the 1930s facilitated racial segregation, as local civic leaders concentrated the benefits in whiter and wealthier areas of the city (Hanchett 1998, 228). Redlining, discriminatory federal aid loans to homebuyers, urban renewal projects, and the construction of public housing away from the wedge of the city further segregated the city into a wedge and crescent (Hanchett 1998).

![Figure 1. The Crescent and Wedge in Mecklenburg County courtesy of UNCC (Dunn 2017)](images/charlotte%20segregation.jpg)

Though the process of desegregation in Charlotte began in its parks during the 1960s, its schools remained segregated until the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in *Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Board of Education* required students to be bused “in order to achieve racial integration” (Ervin 2015; Hanchett 1998, 252). In 2001, however, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with a white parent who sued the school district because “he believed his daughter was not admitted into a local magnet school because of her race” (Smith 2016). This ended the busing policy and reversed much of the desegregation efforts in the county (Smith 2016). Contemporary studies confirm that Mecklenburg County remains racially and economically segregated into a wealthy, white urban crescent and a racialized, low-income wedge bordered by wealthy, white suburbs in the northern part of the county (Garo, Allen-Handy, and Lewis 2018).

## Mecklenburg County's Greenway System

### 1960s-1999

Though greenways are mentioned in Mecklenburg County’s 1966 master plan, the county released its first master plan for a greenway system in 1980 (Sigmon 1980, 1). By this time, the county had developed the McAlpine Greenway in 1979 in southeast Mecklenburg County, yet still “lagged behind other North Carolina cities in available park acres per thousand persons.” (Sigmon 1980, 2). Thus, 20% of the Park Bond Package in 1980 was dedicated to greenway acquisition (Sigmon 1980, 3).

The county cites flood control, wildlife protection, pollution control, microclimate control, and social and economic benefits as primary reasons to develop a greenway system (Sigmon 1980, 5–11). The report notes that the presence of greenspace has “a positive effect upon adjacent property values” and that “‘good esthetics make good economics’” (Sigmon 1980, 10; William H Whyte quoted in Sigmon 1980). Proposed greenway additions were given scores based on population density, potential to link other community centers, type of surrounding development, accessibility, anticipated growth of the population around it, and esthetics. The social benefits that the plan lists include “encouraging neighborhood pride and interaction, increasing property values, and by encouraging walking for enjoyment or to nearby destinations” (Sigmon 1980, 11). It outlines its eventual goal as encircling the county with 73 miles of greenways to “link parks, school-park property, and population centers” (Sigmon 1980, 15). By 2000, however, the county had developed only 16 miles of greenway, most of which were in southern Mecklenburg County.

Rhetoric in the 1980 plan articulates how central greenways are to the county’s identity, and therefore, its branding. The report acknowledges that urban parks “are perfect expressions of a culture,” that greenways are fundamental to the identity of other cities with similar greenway systems, and linked parks can add to cities’ “cohesive, positive image” (Sigmon 1980, 4–14). Yet the proposed additions in the 1980 plan are mostly concentrated in southern portions of Charlotte and near UNCC in the northeast of the city.

The implementation of the plan, however, proved difficult. The plan emerged only after years of opposition to converting floodplains to greenways due to fears that the trails would “attract crowds and disturb suburban tranquility,” and in the case of McAlpine Greenway Park, “would become a haven for ‘dope-smokers and hippies’” (Israel 1982b). These objections stalled greenway development in the county for nearly 20 years, but a 1978 bond referendum elicited pro-greenway sentiments from residents. \$4.75 million was then approved for the first phase of the greenway plan (*The Charlotte Observer* 1980). In 1981, the County Commissioners determined implementing the greenway plan to be a priority for the county (Israel 1981). A year after the plan was published, commissioners were divided on their role in implementing the plan and began to question the feasibility of such an undertaking, particularly in an era of “fiscal conservatism” (Israel 1982b). Though the county committed \$4 million to buy land for greenways, anxieties arose about the cost of maintaining them (Israel 1982a). Additions to the system were “gifts of developers in search of tax benefits or rezoning considerations” or purchased land tracts (Borden 1985). A 1991 update to the plan was completed but never approved (Haden-Stanziale 1999, 9). In 1992, the city and county parks departments merged, and the ensuing restructuring further sidetracked the development of greenways (Henderson 1998).

### **1999-2009 Mecklenburg County Greenway Master Plan**

After the failure of the 1980 plan to gain traction, the county hired consultants to formulate a 1999 plan over the course of a year. The 1999-2009 greenway master plan’s goals included preserving and reclaiming floodplains to improve water quality, protect habitat, and provide recreational, educational, and transportation opportunities; creating multi-use trails that are connected to parks and preserves for pedestrian and bicycle use; and including public-private partnerships between civic, corporate, and governmental actors (Haden-Stanziale 1999, 31). The plan was devised in part by community input through fourteen public workshops throughout the master planning process in different areas of the county (Haden-Stanziale 1999, 38). The “plan of action” outlined in the document also advocates for including residents and adjacent property owners in the feasibility of greenway trails (Haden-Stanziale 1999, 47)

The plan recommends that the greenway system also include “floodplain management and water quality buffer objectives” to reduce property damage and loss from flooding (Haden-Stanziale 1999, 37). The 1999-2009 plan also outlined the roles of various actors involved, which had proved a source of confusion after the 1980 plan.

Criteria for prioritizing land, cost of trail facility development and maintenance, expansion of existing system, geographical equity, need for trail segment ownership of land, logic of origin and destination, population within a one-mile radius of the greenway, public support, funding, and type of trail are all factors outlined in the criteria considered for trail development in the 1999-2009 plan. The inclusion of geographic equity and need for a trail segment in development priorities demonstrates the county’s knowledge that certain residential areas were underserved by the greenway system (Haden-Stanziale 1999, 49). However, the equitable distribution of greenway segments was not a consideration for prioritizing land acquisition.

The implementation of the 1999-2009 plan also experienced snags. In 2004, controversy erupted over “closed-door proceedings” in purchasing land from Bank of America and a small servicing company for the Little Sugar Creek trail (Hudson 2004). Residents living along planned greenways often protested trails that “ran too close to their homes,” raising fears of the county condemning homes to acquire land for greenway development, or that greenways would depress their housing values (Johnston 2006; Hastings 2004; Beshears 2007). Some expressed “not in my backyard” sentiments concerning greenways; one woman stated that she was “‘not against greenways...but \[she was\] against greenways that cut \[her\] backyard in half’” (Barbour 2008). Still other residents welcomed greenways near their homes, such as in the case of the Steele Creek greenway (Hoyle 2007). As of 2008, however, the county had developed 30 miles of greenways within 14 corridors, including the Little Sugar Creek greenway, which occupied top spots in the top-ranked projects in Park and Recreation's 5-year trail development plan and would later serve as part of the Cross Charlotte Trail (XCLT) (“Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Greenway Plan Update 2008” 2008; Sullivan 2008).

### **2008 Mecklenburg County Greenway Master Plan Update and 2015 Comprehensive**

**Park and Recreation Master Plan Update**

A 2008 update to the greenway master plan included a description of the existing system, a plan of action, evaluations of development practices and regulatory policies and programs, and a list of recommendations for programming greenways. The plan update includes survey data indicating that walking, biking, and nature trails were ranked as highly desirable by the public (“Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Greenway Plan Update 2008” 2008, s-1).

The 5-year action plan involved the construction of 42.8 miles of new greenway trail by 2013, to prioritize efforts for the 10 year trail development plan, to improve connectivity of existing trails, and to enhance the greenway’s merit as a “conservation and enhancement tool” (“Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Greenway Plan Update 2008” 2008, s-5). The 10-year action plan aimed to provide 61.9 miles of new greenway trail by 2018 for a total of 129 miles of greenway in the county and to facilitate a “multi-agency approach” to trail development” (“Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Greenway Plan Update 2008” 2008, s-5). The update advocated for a “stakeholder approach” to planning greenways, in which potential stakeholders would be identified for segments and invited to participate in the planning process. The 5- and 10- year plans were estimated to cost \$161.3 million (“Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Greenway Plan Update 2008” 2008, s-6).

A chapter of the 2015 Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Master Plan is dedicated to the greenway system. This plan reaffirms the stakeholder approach, introduces 268 miles of additional planned greenway trails, reiterates previous goals to connect neighborhoods and preserve wildlife and floodplains, and introduces new goals, such as enhancing cultural awareness and identity (“Comprehensive Park & Recreation Master Plan Update: Final Report” 2015, 67). This plan acknowledges the need to enhance greenway trails in the central region of the county (“Comprehensive Park & Recreation Master Plan Update: Final Report” 2015, 73).

Since the 2008 plan update, the greenway system has expanded to 52 miles, less than halfway to its goal of 129 miles (Ellenburg 2019). The lack of progress is in part due to the 2008 recession and subsequent slow recovery (Henderson 2018).

### Present Day: Cross Charlotte Trail

The Cross Charlotte Trail is a joint city-county project to construct a 26-mile trail that runs from the southwest of the county to the University of North Carolina Charlotte campus in the northeast of the county. It would connect three existing greenway systems – Little Sugar Creek, Toby Creek, and Mallard Creek greenways – and be within a half mile of 98,000 jobs and 80,000 residents (“Cross Charlotte Trail Master Plan” 2016, 7). Though intended to be one of the city’s “signature projects,” funding for the trail was \$77 million short as of early 2019 (Portillo 2019a). The city government decided on a temporary solution that would place bike lanes rather than finished greenways in some portions of the plan (Portillo 2019b). Portions closer to the Little Sugar Creek Trail in the south of the county would be prioritized because pre-existing trails in the area could be linked. This response will likely further entrench disparate access to greenways in the county, as the Little Sugar Creek Trail is in the whiter and wealthier “wedge” of the city, while bike lanes would be placed in lower-income areas with higher concentrations of people of color (Portillo 2019b).

This plan also cites “access for all” as a key goal of the trail, along with user experience, transportation, economic development, placemaking, feasibility, and public benefit and support (“Cross Charlotte Trail Master Plan” 2016, 11). Equity, however, is framed only in terms on “income, age, access, and car ownership” (“Cross Charlotte Trail Master Plan” 2016, 46).

Though the “historical context” portion of the plan mentions the county’s “rail and cotton beginnings,” it does not include the area’s history of settler-colonialism, slavery, and segregation, suggesting a “color-blind” method of urban planning that obscures how these histories translate into modern realities (“Cross Charlotte Trail Master Plan” 2016, 17). In fact, the plan makes no mention of race whatsoever.

The plan does include considerations for socioeconomic status in equitable placement (Figure 2) but does not discuss the potential for the trail to alter the surrounding low-income neighborhoods through displacement of long-term residents (“Cross Charlotte Trail Master Plan” 2016, 26). Moreover, the maps in the plan do not consider racial demographics, further erasing segregation of the city.

![Figure 2. Poverty Levels along the XCLT plan. From the Cross Charlotte Trail Master Plan, 2016](images/poverty%20xclt-01.png)

Though planners sought community input in devising the plan, the plan does not mention what recruitment methods were employed or how effective they were at reaching those most vulnerable to displacement.

Due to funding gaps and the size of the trail, the XCLT will be implemented in phases. Earlier phases will occur in Segments 1 and 2, areas with “strong development potential,” to raise funds for and justify the existence of the trail in Segments 3 and 4. As seen in Figure 2, Segments 1 and 2 have significant portions with high rates of poverty. Though this development could help alleviate inequitable access to greenways in the county, it could also contribute to displacement in these areas.

The XCLT plan likens its governance structure to that of the Midtown Greenway in Minneapolis, Minnesota (“Cross Charlotte Trail Master Plan” 2016, 158). Both plans would have local governments as their principal operators but would receive support from a non-profit and the private sector. This does not bode well for gentrification along the trail, as the Midtown Greenway has contributed to gentrification in Minneapolis (Johnson 2015).

Other similar “mega-trails” have also contributed to gentrification in their respective cities, such as the Highline in New York, the 606 in Chicago, and the BeltLine in Atlanta (Loughran 2014; Harris et al. 2019; Powers 2017). The BeltLine, like the XCLT, is in a large southeastern city and thus the context of the two trails may be comparable. The master plan for the BeltLine even included a principle concerned with preventing displacement through expanding housing options (Tunnel-Spangler Walsh & Associates, Grice & Associates, Inc., and Smith Dalia Architects 2010, 4). Yet gentrification has occurred along the trail, displacing many long-term residents (Immergluck 2009). Comparing the XCLT context to other similar mega-trails suggest that the XCLT is also likely to displace residents in Mecklenburg County.

## Plan Analysis

The role of the private sector, and the real estate industry in particular, occupies much of the discourse on greenway planning in Mecklenburg County. All plans reference public-private partnerships, which are a hallmark of the neoliberal city (Heame 2014). Opposition to and advocacy for greenways exists around concern for property values. In the inception of the greenway system, opponents feared the trails would depress property values, and now, greenway proponents cite enhanced property values as a reason to develop more greenways.  Greenway opponents worried that greenways would attract dangerous “outsiders” that would endanger their neighborhoods and lower property values. These sentiments persisted throughout the greenway’s history; in 2001, residents living along the proposed Three Mile Branch greenway objected due to “security concerns” (Rubin 2001). Such rhetoric, when viewed in the context of racial segregation in Mecklenburg County, demonstrate the role that racism plays in shaping greenway discourse in Mecklenburg County.

The plans also acknowledge the importance of greenways in enhancing the “image” of the city and county. In one article from *The Charlotte Observer*, a consultant involved in the 1999-2009 plan mused, “The big question is, will we be able to get the private sector to be part of that?” (Henderson 1998). In the same article, writer Bruce Henderson discusses how one benefit of greenways is attracting corporate relocations. Thus, the case is typical of neoliberal urban greening: the county emphasized its commitment to provision of green space through the creation of a greenway system, but conservative fiscal policies precluded effective implementation, suggesting that the county practiced greenwashing rather than impactful provision. This is the tension of providing socioenvironmental amenities in a neoliberal context.

Community responses to greenways in Mecklenburg County frame the trail system as an amenity in some cases and as an unwanted land use in others. Both framings are inextricable from the legacy of racism and segregation in the county. In the framing of greenways as amenities, the situation of such amenities is likely to privilege whiter, wealthier areas because of racist urban planning. Meanwhile, white residents framing greenways as an unwanted land use is partially rooted in the fear of a racialized “other” and integration.

Though plans mention geographic equity as a concern when planning greenways, no plans explicitly mention equitable distribution according to socioeconomic factors. Further, the plans frame increased property values only as a benefit, and do not acknowledge the potential for increased property values to displace people through gentrification.

Plans also employ collaborative planning in many instances to incorporate community input in greenway plans. Though a seemingly democratic decision-making process, in the context of market-led planning, this approach to planning can reinforce neoliberal hegemony rather than challenging it, which can then exacerbate neoliberal phenomenon such as gentrification (Roy 2015).
