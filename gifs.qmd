title: "Digital Art"

*In a past life, I dabbled in digital art. I developed these GIFs in Photoshop during the spring of 2020 for a digital art course at Davidson College. The task involved creating frame by frame animations inspired by fictitious art works described in [The Ambrose J. and Vivian T. Seagrave Museum of 20th Century American Art by Matthew Kirkpatrick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGYWN64/ref=docs-os-doi_0). I am the sole creator of these GIFs.*

Bonus: this was the first GIF I made, inspired by a photo collage I made of pictures taken on my study abroad program to Buenos Aires, Barcelona, and Cape Town.
