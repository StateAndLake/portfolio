## The Illinois Medical District

In the spring of 2023, I was part of a semester-long group project to develop a plan for the Illinois Medical District, a 560-acre special-use zoning district just west of the Loop in Chicago, Illinois.

For our midterm presentation, I produced this GIF to illustrate the change in land uses over time in the district. The animation makes the injuries of urban renewal apparent. Vacant lots, surface parking, and institutional uses with large setbacks replaced an entire neighborhood in the southern portion of the district from the 1970s through the 2000s.

## New Nicollet Redevelopment

As part of the American Planning Association 2024 Student Planning and Design Competition, I developed a GIF of aerial imagery over time of the project site: a former Kmart in Minneapolis, Minnesota along Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue. The construction of this KMart required the closure of Nicollet Avenue at Lake Street to accommodate the building and its parking lot, cutting off the area south of Lake Street from an important corridor.

The City of Minneapolis approved the termination of the Kmart lease in 2020 with the goal of reconnecting Nicollet. This GIF illustrates how disruptive both the construction of Interstate 35W and the development of the Kmart was to the urban tissue of the neighborhood.
