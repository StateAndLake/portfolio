title: "Encuentro Square Park"
---

*This project was completed in Fall of 2023 for a course on spatial planning methods. I envisioned a park for the Encuentro Square affordable housing development, which was under construction at the time. The plan for the site included an ambiguous "phase III" in which a park would be developed just south of the buildings at an unspecified later date. The proximity of this site to the 606 trail provides an opportunity for a connected system of green space and trails. I completed these works alone using Illustrator and SketchUp.*

## Site Plan

My vision for the site includes opportunities for intergenerational play and connection through flexible spaces and varied play and exercise equipment. A train-themed play structure references the adjacent train tracks, and a permeable parking lot could be activated through festivals and block parties. A splash pad would provide reprieve from heat on summer days.
